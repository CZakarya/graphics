# This is the naming convention for the Zak Branding files.
The main rule for the source files is to be named with snake_case. For example:

- `hello_world`
- `zakhat_solid_black`

The order of the adjectives should generally have the main concept first, variant description in the middle, and colors last. For example:

- `zakhat_small_solid_blue`

The colors should be written with the name first, then the variant number without a space ( ), underline (_) or dash (-).

- `helloworld_blue3` - this refers to Zakarya Middle Blue.

The colors should refer to the Zakarya Branding color chart. All colors should be consistent throughout all designs, including transparency.
